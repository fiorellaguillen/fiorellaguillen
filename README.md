<h1 align="center">Hi there!ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Fiorella Guillen! I'm a postgraduate student in Urban Spatial Science at UCL with a background in architecture and urbanism. I'm passionate about sustainable urban development and using spatial analysis to tackle urban challenges. I love working with data to understand cities better, especially in areas like urban analysis, transport networks, and urban policy.
